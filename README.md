# Final Project, Iteration 1: Dive Bug
A project by Caleb Van Lue.

## How to Play
In this early iteration of Dive Bug, Tug is exploring the waters! Using A and D or the left and right arrow keys, Tug can move left and right on the screen. To swim upwards, press Space. To swim more towards the surface, you can repeatedly press space to gain momentum and move upwards. To move slightly faster, hold Shift. 

Tug is also learning how to defend himself! He recently discovered his ability to shoot fireballs (yes, fireballs) underwater! To shoot in the direction that he is facing, press Enter. Fireballs need a short time to recover, but can be shot relatively quickly. 


## Project Report
Though my project may not feel like a complete game just yet, I am proud of what I have come up with. In terms of the progress that I had planned on for this first iteration, I feel that I have succeeded in completing those requirements and creating elements in this game to work exactly as I'd want them. Of course, a lot of my time was spent experimenting with my code. I wanted to mimic a Mario-esque underwater level style for my physics engine, which I feel turned out relatively well. I will likely improve upon it as time goes on.

I personally believe that a lot of the value that a player receives from a game comes from the main character: the one that they are controlling. Things like movement, animations, abilities and things of that nature really create a connection between the player and the game, and if its strong enough, that game could become a lifelong favorite. I feel that the work I put into the player's abilities and movement in this iteration help to make my project more enjoyable to play and move around in. I'm very excited to start implementing enemies to give more of a purpose to the game.

Something that I feel I could improve upon is my time committment to this project. I've had quite a few other large projects and personal issues going on these past few weeks and I saw this project as one that could sit on the back burner for awhile. Lo and behold, I regret that decision and it is something that I will improve upon in future iterations. This project gets me excited now.

Overall I am proud of the progress that I've made. Though there isn't much of an objective yet, the player movement is fun and the abilities such as the fireball give a nice preview as to where the game is heading. I feel that I put forth a great submission based on my initial plan for this iteration and I am excited to continue moving forward.
